# 💳 Credit-card-fraud-detection-ML-model

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning algorithms. The model is trained on a dataset containing legitimate and fraudulent transactions, enabling it to distinguish between normal and suspicious activities effectively.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Preprocessing of imbalanced credit card transaction data
- Implementation of multiple machine learning models
- Evaluation of model performance using accuracy, precision
- Detection of fraudulent transactions with high accuracy

---

## 📂 Project Structure
- **model/->** Contains the trained ML model (credit_card_model.pkl) 
- **credit_card_data.csv->** Dataset used for training
- **requirements.txt->** Lists required dependencies

---

## 📊 Dataset
- The dataset used contains real-world credit card transactions.
- It is highly imbalanced, requiring undersampling techniques.
